# graph-coloring-fermion-parallelization
Code for the paper: "Parallelization techniques for quantum simulation of fermionic systems" by Jacob Bringewatt and Zohreh Davoudi

File list:

main.cpp - contains parallelization code. Run -h flag for inputs.
Makefile - compiles the code. Requires boost libraries.
src/ - contains a collection of sample input files. These are graphviz files which encode the system graphs and interaction graphs. See paper for detailed definitions.
